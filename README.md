Getting started
===============

1. Download the project from Github, either as a zip file or as forked repository in your git tool of choice.

2. Download composer. Composer is a package management tool for PHP. It can be downloaded from http://getcomposer.org/download/ or by running the command `curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`


3. Run the command `php composer.phar install` if the composer.lock file hasn't been added to the project yet. Otherwise run `php composer.phar install`.

4. Make sure that the directory zfsyd.org/data is writable by your PHP process.
